# Terraform Overview

### What is Terraform?

Terraform is an open-source tool that enables infrastructure management through "Infrastructure as Code" (IaC). It allows you to define and provision infrastructure such as servers, databases, networks, and cloud services using simple configuration files. Instead of manually creating and managing resources through a web interface, Terraform allows you to write code to automate the entire process.

For instance, if you need to create a server in cloud environments such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud, you can define the desired configuration in a `.tf` file, and Terraform will automatically provision and manage the resource for you. 

### Example Usage

1. Define infrastructure in `.tf` files.
2. Run `terraform apply` to create or modify the infrastructure.
3. Run `terraform destroy` to remove the infrastructure.

Terraform supports a wide variety of providers, such as AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and many others.
